Game of Life in scala to demonstrate property testing

@wolfendale and I paired on this kata as an exercise in driving code with property tests.
We're tried to build the commit history to tell the story of our thinking process as we went.

To "follow along", check out the first commit then each one in turn, reading the commit message
to get an explanation of what we wanted to do and why.
